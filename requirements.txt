# Vector database and local embeddings (commented out for OpenAI-only setup)
# Uncomment these if switching to local/Ollama setup:
# chromadb                 # Vector database storage - requires torch/CUDA
# langchain-community      # Additional LangChain integrations
# langchain-nomic          # Nomic embeddings provider
# sentence_transformers    # Local HuggingFace embeddings - requires torch/CUDA
