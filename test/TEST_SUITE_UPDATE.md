- **Fixture-Based Setup**: Reusable test components and configurations
- **Test Markers**: Categorization for selective test execution
- **Environment Awareness**: Automatic skipping when dependencies unavailable
- **Detailed Reporting**: Comprehensive test results with timing and statistics

### üîÑ CI/CD Ready
- **Timeout Handling**: Prevents hanging tests in CI environments
- **Exit Codes**: Proper success/failure reporting
- **Environment Checking**: Validates prerequisites before test execution
- **Categorized Execution**: Run subsets based on environment capabilities

## Usage Examples

### Quick Start
```bash
# Essential test - start here
./test_runner.sh quick

# Full modern test suite
./test_runner.sh full

# Performance benchmarks
./test_runner.sh performance
```

### Advanced Usage
```bash
# Run specific categories
uv run python test/run_all_tests.py --category "Core FastAPI Tests"

# Pytest with filtering
uv run pytest test/test_pytest_core.py -m "not slow" -v

# Performance testing
uv run python test/test_performance.py
```

### Development Workflow
```bash
# Test-driven development
uv run pytest test/test_pytest_core.py -k "test_new_feature" -v

# Quick validation during development
./test_runner.sh quick

# Full validation before commit
./test_runner.sh all
```

## Performance Baselines

Based on current test data (26 documents):

- **Vector Search**: <1 second for similarity search
- **RAG Q&A**: <20 seconds end-to-end (including LLM generation)
- **First Token**: <1 second for streaming responses
- **Concurrent Users**: Handles 5 simultaneous users efficiently
- **Memory Usage**: <100MB increase for typical workload

## Backward Compatibility

All existing tests remain functional:
- **test_basic_functionality_fastapi.py**: Still the primary production test
- **test_filtering.py**: Detailed filtering functionality tests
- **Legacy tests**: Available for LangChain-based components

## Future Enhancements

The new infrastructure supports:
- **Coverage Reporting**: pytest-cov integration ready
- **Continuous Integration**: GitHub Actions workflow templates
- **Load Testing**: Scalable concurrent user simulation
- **Regression Testing**: Automated performance baseline comparison
- **Test Data Management**: Fixtures for different dataset sizes

## Migration Guide

### For Developers
1. **Primary Test**: Use `./test_runner.sh quick` for development validation
2. **New Features**: Add tests to `test_pytest_core.py` using fixture patterns
3. **Performance**: Use `test_performance.py` for benchmarking new features
4. **CI/CD**: Use `./test_runner.sh all` for comprehensive validation

### For Production
1. **Deployment Validation**: Run `./test_runner.sh core` after deployments
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Regular `./test_runner.sh performance` execution
3. **Health Checks**: API integration tests for live system validation

This comprehensive test suite update provides a solid foundation for reliable development, deployment, and maintenance of the RAG-YouTube system while maintaining full backward compatibility with existing workflows.
