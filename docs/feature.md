# Playlist-Aware RAG Feature Specification

> **Status**: ðŸ”„ **Planning Phase** - Future enhancement not yet implemented
> 
> **Current System**: Basic RAG with SpotGamma channel data working
> **This Document**: Feature specification for planned playlist filtering capabilities

## Overview

This feature enhances RAG-YouTube to support playlist-based organization and retrieval, enabling users to query specific playlists or use playlist metadata to improve search relevance. This is particularly valuable for channels that organize content into thematic playlists.

## Motivation

YouTube channels often organize videos into playlists based on:
- **Topic/Theme**: Educational series, product reviews, tutorials
- **Time Period**: Daily updates, weekly shows, monthly summaries  
- **Content Type**: Interviews, analysis, news, educational content
- **Skill Level**: Beginner, intermediate, advanced

Currently, RAG-YouTube treats all channel videos as a flat collection, missing valuable organizational context that could improve retrieval accuracy and user experience.

## User Stories

### Story 1: Financial Analyst Using SpotGamma
**As a** financial analyst learning about options trading  
**I want to** query only the "Options Education" playlist  
**So that** I get educational content without mixing in daily market commentary

**Example Query**: "How do gamma squeezes work?"
- **Current**: Returns mix of educational content and daily market updates
- **Proposed**: Returns only content from educational playlists

### Story 2: Researcher Excluding Time-Sensitive Content
**As a** researcher studying market mechanics  
**I want to** exclude "Daily Market Updates" playlist  
**So that** I focus on evergreen educational content

**Example Query**: "Explain SPX options flow"
- **Current**: Dominated by recent daily updates
- **Proposed**: Returns conceptual explanations from educational content

### Story 3: Developer Learning from Tutorial Channel
**As a** developer learning a new framework  
**I want to** search within the "Advanced Patterns" playlist  
**So that** I skip beginner content I already know

### Story 4: Content Creator Analyzing Their Channel
**As a** content creator  
**I want to** see which playlists generate the most relevant responses  
**So that** I can improve my content organization

## Feature Comparison

| Capability | Current System | With Playlist Support |
|------------|----------------|----------------------|
| Query Scope | Entire channel | Specific playlists |
| Context Awareness | Video-level only | Playlist + video context |
| Filtering | None | Include/exclude playlists |
| Organization | Flat list | Hierarchical structure |
| Metadata | Title, description | + Playlist name, position |
| UI Options | Search box only | + Playlist selector |
| Performance | Search all videos | Search subset |

## Implementation Approaches

### Approach 1: Query-Time Filtering
- User selects playlists before each query
- Real-time filtering of search results
- Maximum flexibility

### Approach 2: Playlist-Specific Instances
- Separate vector DB per playlist
- Pre-filtered at ingestion time
- Best performance

### Approach 3: Hybrid Model
- Single vector DB with metadata
- Common playlists cached separately
- Balance of flexibility and performance

## Future Enhancements

1. **Auto-Playlist Detection**: Automatically suggest relevant playlists based on query
2. **Playlist Relationships**: Link related playlists for comprehensive answers
3. **Temporal Awareness**: Weight recent content differently in time-sensitive playlists
4. **Custom Groupings**: User-defined video collections beyond YouTube playlists
5. **Playlist Analytics**: Dashboard showing query patterns per playlist

## Conclusion

Playlist-aware RAG transforms a flat video collection into a structured knowledge base that respects the content creator's organization while serving users' specific needs. This feature is essential for channels with diverse content types and will significantly improve the retrieval experience for both casual users and power users.
