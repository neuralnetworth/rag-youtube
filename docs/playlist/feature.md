# Practical Content Filtering Feature Specification

> **Status**: ðŸ”„ **Planning Phase** - Simplified enhancement ready for implementation
> 
> **Current System**: Basic RAG with SpotGamma channel data (192/341 videos with captions)
> **This Document**: Feature specification for practical filtering using simple metadata enhancement

## Overview

This feature introduces practical content filtering by enhancing video metadata during document loading. Using simple pattern matching and basic calculations, we add caption availability tracking, title-based categorization, quality scoring, and playlist organization. This lightweight approach dramatically improves the user experience without complex infrastructure.

## Motivation

Current issues that simple filtering can solve:

### Accessibility Gap
- **56% Caption Coverage**: Only 192 of 341 videos have captions
- **Mixed Results**: Queries return both accessible and inaccessible content
- **No Visibility**: Users can't filter for captioned content

### Content Organization
- **Flat Structure**: All 341 videos treated equally
- **No Categories**: Daily updates mixed with educational content
- **Quality Unknown**: No way to find high-quality transcriptions

### Simple Solutions
- **Caption Filter**: Let users see only accessible content
- **Title Categories**: Infer content type from video titles
- **Basic Quality**: Score captions by words-per-minute
- **Playlist Groups**: Use YouTube's existing organization

With minimal effort, we can provide powerful filtering that addresses real user needs.

## Implementation Approach

### Three Simple Phases

**Phase 1: Caption & Categories** (2-3 days)
- Modify document_loader_faiss.py to add metadata
- Add caption detection and category inference
- Create filter statistics API endpoint
- Add caption checkbox to UI

**Phase 2: Quality & Keywords** (2-3 days)
- Calculate quality scores during loading
- Count technical term occurrences
- Add quality and category dropdowns
- Enhance API with combined filtering

**Phase 3: Playlists** (2-3 days)
- Fetch playlist data from YouTube API
- Map videos to playlists
- Add playlist multi-select filter
- Create filter presets

### Why This Works
- **Incremental Value**: Each phase provides immediate benefits
- **Low Risk**: Simple changes to existing code
- **User Testing**: Get feedback after each phase
- **Maintainable**: Easy to understand and modify

## Future Possibilities

Once the basic system is working, you could consider:

1. **More Categories**: Add patterns as you discover them
2. **Better Quality Metrics**: Refine the scoring algorithm
3. **More Keywords**: Expand technical term list
4. **Smart Defaults**: Learn from user behavior
5. **Export Filters**: Save/share filter combinations

But these are optional - the basic system provides tremendous value as-is.

## Conclusion

Practical Content Filtering transforms RAG-YouTube from a basic search tool into an accessible, organized knowledge base. By adding simple metadata during document loading, we solve real user problems:

- **Accessibility**: Hearing-impaired users can find content they can actually use
- **Organization**: Beginners aren't overwhelmed by daily market noise
- **Quality**: Researchers can find detailed, searchable transcripts
- **Efficiency**: Everyone saves time with focused results

Best of all, this requires no complex infrastructure - just smart use of existing data. The result is a dramatically improved user experience with minimal development effort.
