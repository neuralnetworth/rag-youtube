# Unified Content Intelligence Feature Specification

> **Status**: ðŸ”„ **Planning Phase** - Future enhancement not yet implemented
> 
> **Current System**: Basic RAG with SpotGamma channel data (192/341 videos with captions)
> **This Document**: Feature specification for unified content intelligence system

## Overview

This feature introduces a comprehensive content intelligence system that analyzes YouTube channels across multiple dimensions in a single, efficient pass. Rather than separate caption and playlist analysis, the unified approach provides deep insights into content quality, organization, relationships, and patterns - enabling intelligent multi-dimensional filtering and retrieval that dramatically improves user experience.

## Motivation

Current RAG systems miss critical content intelligence that affects retrieval quality:

### Multi-Dimensional Content Understanding
- **Quality Dimensions**: Caption availability (56% coverage), technical accuracy, completeness
- **Organizational Structure**: Playlists, series, temporal patterns, content relationships
- **Content Intelligence**: Topic clusters, complexity levels, temporal relevance
- **User Accessibility**: Hearing-impaired access, language quality, technical depth

### Unified Analysis Benefits
- **Single Pass Efficiency**: Analyze all dimensions together, discovering correlations
- **Relationship Discovery**: Find connections between caption quality and content type
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify which playlists have quality issues
- **Predictive Insights**: Suggest improvements based on comprehensive analysis

Currently, RAG-YouTube treats all videos as isolated entities, missing the rich interconnections and quality signals that could transform retrieval accuracy and user experience.

## User Stories

### Story 1: Quality-Focused Learner
**As a** student learning options trading  
**I want to** see only videos with high-quality captions  
**So that** I can follow along with accurate transcripts and searchable content

**Example Query**: "How do gamma squeezes work?" + "Require Captions" filter
- **Current**: Returns mix of captioned (accurate) and uncaptioned (video-only) content
- **Proposed**: Returns only the 192 captioned videos with reliable text content

### Story 2: Accessibility User
**As a** hearing-impaired trader  
**I want to** automatically exclude videos without captions  
**So that** I can access all returned content effectively

**Example Query**: Any query with accessibility settings enabled
- **Current**: 43% of results are inaccessible (no captions)
- **Proposed**: 100% of results have captions and are fully accessible

### Story 3: Educational Focus with Quality Assurance
**As a** financial analyst learning about options trading
