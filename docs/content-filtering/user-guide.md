# Content Filtering User Guide

## Overview

The content filtering system helps you find exactly what you're looking for by narrowing down search results based on video characteristics. This guide explains how to use each filter type effectively.

## Available Filters

### 1. Caption Filter

**What it does**: Only searches videos that have transcripts/captions available.

**When to use it**:
- When you need exact quotes or detailed information
- When accuracy is more important than coverage
- When you want to ensure searchable content

**How to use it**:
- Check the "Require captions" checkbox
- The caption coverage (e.g., "192/341 videos") shows how many videos have captions

### 2. Category Filter

**What it does**: Limits results to specific content types.

**Categories**:
- **Daily Updates**: Market recaps, daily analysis, opening/closing bell coverage
- **Educational**: Tutorials, explainers, "What is..." content
- **Interviews**: Conversations, Q&As, discussions with guests
- **Special Events**: OPEX coverage, FOMC meetings, earnings events, live streams

**When to use it**:
- Looking for educational content? Select "Educational"
- Want recent market analysis? Select "Daily Updates"
- Interested in expert opinions? Select "Interviews"

### 3. Quality Filter

**What it does**: Filters by content density and technical depth.

**Quality Levels**:
- **High**: Dense, technical content with lots of domain-specific terms
- **Medium**: Moderate technical content with good information density
- **Low**: Basic content, may be more conversational or introductory

**When to use it**:
- For deep technical analysis, select "High"
- For balanced content, select "Medium"
- For introductory content, include "Low"

### 4. Date Range Filter

**What it does**: Limits results to videos published within a specific time period.

**When to use it**:
- Finding recent market analysis (last week/month)
- Researching historical events (specific date range)
- Excluding outdated information

**How to use it**:
- Click the date input fields
- Select start and end dates from the calendar
- Leave either field empty for open-ended ranges

## Using Multiple Filters

### Filter Combination Logic

All filters work together using AND logic:
- A video must match ALL selected filters to appear in results
- The more filters you apply, the more specific your results

### Examples

**Example 1: Recent Technical Education**
- Category: Educational
- Quality: High
- Date: Last 3 months
- Result: Dense educational content from recent months

**Example 2: This Week's Market Updates**
- Category: Daily Updates
- Require Captions: ✓
- Date: This week
- Result: Transcribed daily market analysis from this week

**Example 3: Expert Interviews on Special Events**
- Category: Interviews
- Quality: High or Medium
- Result: In-depth conversations with experts

## Best Practices

### 1. Start Broad, Then Narrow

Begin with fewer filters and add more if you get too many results:
1. Start with just category or date range
2. Add quality filter if needed
3. Enable caption requirement for precision

### 2. Use Caption Filter Wisely

- **Pros**: More accurate results, exact quotes possible
- **Cons**: Excludes ~40% of content
- **Tip**: Try without it first, then enable if results are poor

### 3. Quality Level Selection

- **High + Medium**: Best for research and learning
- **All Levels**: Best for comprehensive coverage
- **High Only**: Best for expert-level content

### 4. Date Range Tips

- Recent content (last month) for current market conditions
- Specific dates for event-related research
- Broader ranges for trend analysis

## Troubleshooting

### "No results found"

Your filters may be too restrictive. Try:
1. Removing one filter at a time
2. Broadening date ranges
3. Including more quality levels
4. Unchecking "Require captions"

### Results seem unrelated

This might happen when:
- Filters are too broad
- The question doesn't match the filtered content
- Try more specific filters or refine your question

### Filter counts seem wrong

The counts show videos matching each individual filter, not combinations:
- "Educational (78 videos)" means 78 educational videos total
- Combining with other filters may yield fewer results

## Clear Filters

To reset all filters:
1. Click the "Clear Filters" button
2. All selections will be removed
3. Search will use the entire video database

## Tips for Effective Searching

### 1. Match Question to Filters

Align your question with your filter selection:
- Educational filter → "How does X work?"
- Daily Updates → "What happened in the market today?"
- Interviews → "What do experts think about X?"

### 2. Time-Sensitive Queries

For current events or recent changes:
- Use date filters to limit to recent content
- Combine with "Daily Updates" category
- Enable captions for accuracy

### 3. Learning and Research

For educational purposes:
- Select "Educational" category
- Choose "High" and "Medium" quality
- Don't restrict dates too much (knowledge doesn't expire quickly)

### 4. Comprehensive Analysis

For thorough research on a topic:
- Don't use filters initially
- Review results to understand content distribution
- Then apply filters based on what you find

## Filter Interactions

### Caption + Category
- Most effective combination
- Ensures searchable, categorized content
- Reduces noise significantly

### Quality + Date
- Good for finding recent high-quality content
- Useful for tracking improvement in content over time

### Category + Date
- Perfect for event-specific research
- "Special Events" + specific date = targeted event coverage
